## 💡 Role of Chainlit

FoodieBot leverages the Chainlit framework to provide a seamless conversational experience for users. Here's how Chainlit supports the chatbot's functionality:

1. **User Input Handling:** Chainlit captures user queries and forwards them to the backend for processing.
2. **Response Generation:** The backend uses OpenAI GPT to generate intelligent responses based on user input, such as menu recommendations or order confirmations.
3. **Interactive UI:** Chainlit provides an interactive interface for displaying menus, order summaries, and payment options in real time.
