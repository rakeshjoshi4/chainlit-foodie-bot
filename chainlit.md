## 💡 Role of Chainlit

FoodieBot leverages the Chainlit framework to provide a seamless conversational experience for users. Here's how Chainlit supports the chatbot's functionality:

1.  **User Input Handling:** Chainlit captures user queries and forwards them to the backend for processing.
2.  **Response Generation:** The backend uses OpenAI GPT to generate intelligent responses based on user input, such as menu recommendations or order confirmations.
3.  **Interactive UI:** Chainlit provides an interactive interface for displaying menus, order summaries, and payment options in real time.

## 🛠️ How FoodieBot Works

1.  The user initiates a conversation to explore the menu or place an order.
2.  FoodieBot presents categorized menu options with prices and descriptions.
3.  The user selects dishes, specifies delivery details, and chooses a payment method.
4.  FoodieBot confirms the order and provides an order summary.
    *Please note that this is a simulated ordering process. No actual orders are placed.*
    *If an item is unavailable, FoodieBot will apologize and suggest alternatives from the menu.*

## 🎯 Future Plans

Although this is a prototype project, future enhancements could include:

*   Integration with real-world food delivery services for live ordering functionality.
*   Adding dietary labels (e.g., vegetarian, vegan) and calorie information for dishes to make the menu more informative.
*   Expanding the menu to include more cuisines and dishes from around the world.
*   Implementing voice-based interaction for accessibility and ease of use.
